# Gold Bootstrap 3.3.5
The latest version of Bootstrap based off the golden-ratio.

## The Simple Setup (CSS)
Include `goldbootstrap.css` in your project. That's all. The most recent version of Bootstrap is included.

```html
// Core HTML
//...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="goldbootstrap/css/goldbootstrap.css"> // Add support for Gold Bootstrap
```

## The Simple Setup (LESS)

If you want to use LESS Preprocessors, include `gold-bootstrap.less` after your `bootstrap.less` import, and that's it.

```css
// Core LESS
//...
@import "goldbootstrap/less/goldbootstrap.less"; // Add support for Gold Bootstrap
```

## How to use it
Use any component from the regular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). They're all included.

## What about GOLD Headings?
Extremely simple. Just use regular 'H1' through 'H6' HTML heading tags.

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

## What about the GOLD Grid?
Like you would do with any other Bootstrap column, simply use a set of `.col-gold-sm` and `.col-gold-lg` columns:

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-gold-sm">...</div>
  <div class="col-gold-lg">...</div>
</div>
```
## How it works
Coming soon...

## Versioning
GOLD Bootstrap is always in sync with latest version of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). If 'Bootstrap 9' comes out, we will be 'Gold Bootstrap 9' and so on.
